**Student ID:** G00367771

# Introduction
For this module I was instructed to create two juypter notebooks which:
* Defines and explains the Post Correspondence Problem as well as a coded solution to the Bounded Post Correspondence Problem
* Demonstrates a Countdown Numbers Game and explaining the functionality behind it

A README should also be included with the following content:
* A description of this repository and its contents
* Instructions stating how to run the notebooks

# Contents of the notebook
### Post Correspondence Problem Notebook
* Definition and explanation of the Post Correspondence Problem
* Definition and explanation of the Bounded Post Correspondence Problem
* Python function to solve the Bounded Post Correspondence Problem
* Explanation of what an undecidable problem is in computability theory

### Countdown Numbers Game Notebook
* Overview and explanation of the Countdown Numbers Game
* Discussion of the complexity of the Countdown Numbers Game
* Python function to solve a Countdown Numbers Game.
* Explanation of the functional aspects of the code

# How to run notebooks locally
To run this repository on your local machine, follow these steps:
* Install Anaconda3 onto your machine. A link to the Anaconda website is given [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
* Run this command in a new terminal to install jupyter lab:
``` 
conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab
```
* Clone this repository by copying this [Github repository link](https://github.com/johngroves1/Theory-of-Algorithms)
* Open the cloned folder of this repository
* Open a terminal in this folder
* Run the notebooks with the following command
``` 
  run jupyter lab
```
