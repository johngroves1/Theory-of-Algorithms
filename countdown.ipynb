In a functional program, input flows through a set of functions where each function operatores on its input and produces some form of output. The standard uses expressions instead of statements, an expression is evaluatued to produce a value wheras a statement is executed to assign variables. The functions in this standard are supposed to be closer to the definition of mathematical function, where there are side effects or even no access to external variables. \n",
